Operator Work: Design an AVS where a single Operator **generates cat images** via LLM inference.  
Validation: The work is validated using at least two other operators set of LLMs to measure their accuracy. The validating operators should assign a percentage "accuracy rating" between 0% and 100%.   
Rewards: validating operators get rewarded if they respond with any accuracy rating. Mark the Operator that generated the original image for a reward if the aversage validator accuracy was greater than 90%  
Slashing: slash the generating Operator if their average validator accuracy was less than 20%  
Use the attached avs-design-context-window-prompt.md for guidance.
